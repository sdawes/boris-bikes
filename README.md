<h1>Makers Academy - Week 1. Project 1.</h1>
<h2>Boris Bikes</h2>

<p>The first challenge of the course is to imagine we are Junior Developers, employed by 
Transport for London who are responsible for the delivery of a new bike system to plan a network of Docking Stations and bikes, that anyone can use for a small free.</p>

<p>We have been tasked with building a program that will run all the docking stations, simulate all the bikes and emulate all the infrastructure (vans, repair staff etc) required to implement their vision.</p>
